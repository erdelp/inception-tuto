# 42 Inception: DigitalOcean Setup with GitHub Student Pack

## Goal of working on Inception like this

1. No sgoinfre slowlyness, no heavy VM that takes hour to boot with a GUI, you will be able to work on your VM from anywhere with a terminal (and a valid pubkey)
2. You will never ever in your developer life deploy a project with a VM with a GUI, always on a server over SSH
3. This will refresh the rudimentary server protection you learned on Born2BeRoot
4. You will actually deploy your inception project online with a domain name and all that for FREE !

## Getting Free $200 Credit on DigitalOcean
If you're a student, you can get **$200 in free credit** for DigitalOcean through the GitHub Student Developer Pack:

This will allow you to get a VPS (Virtual Private Server) which is basically your own little VM hosted on DigitalOcean server, you will access it through SSH.

1. Go to [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).
2. Sign in with your **GitHub student account**.
3. Apply for the **DigitalOcean offer**.
4. Create an account using the provided link
5. It will ask for a credit card to check you're real but should not debit it (it will take like 1$ for 7 day to check it's working).
6. **Remember to destroy your VPS once you're done with the project. If you do not YOU WILL BE CREDITED ONCE THE 200$ CREDIT RUN OUT !!!!!**

Note: you need to go to [42 Github Portal](https://github-portal.42.fr.) first to activate it.

**Note: I'm not responsible if you get credited for the use of DigitalOcean, read step by step and check multiple time you're not being billed before starting your VPS (Droplet).
If you carefully follow the step you should not get debited.**

## Creating a DigitalOcean Droplet and Adding SSH Key

### 1. Create a Droplet
1. Log in to your **DigitalOcean account**.
2. Click on **Create â†’ Droplets**.
3. Choose a **Debian image**.
4. Select your **Droplet size** (for inception 2vcpu and 2gb of RAM shoud be enough).
5. Choose a **datacenter region** (pick the closest one for better performance).
6. Under **Authentication**, select **SSH keys**.

### 2. Add Your SSH Key
1. On your local machine, check if you already have an SSH key:
   ```sh
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub || cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```
   If you donâ€™t have one, generate it using:
   ```sh
   ssh-keygen -t ed_25519
   ```
2. Copy your public key:
   ```sh
   cat ~/.ssh/ed_25519.pub
   ```
3. In DigitalOcean, click **New SSH Key**, paste your public key, and save it.
4. Click **Create Droplet** and wait for it to be ready.

### 3. Connect to Your Droplet
Once your droplet is ready, use the following command to connect:
```sh
ssh root@your_server_ip
```

## Securing Your Server

### 1. Create a New User
Create a new user named `login42`:
```sh
adduser login42
```
Add the user to the sudo group:
```sh
usermod -aG sudo login42
```

### 2. Change SSH Port to 4242
Edit the SSH configuration file:
```sh
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
Find the line:
```sh
#Port 22
```
Replace it with:
```sh
Port 4242
```

### 3. Disable Root Login and Password Authentication
Edit the SSH configuration file again:
```sh
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
Find and modify these lines to those values:
```sh
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PermitEmptyPasswords no
AllowUsers login42
MaxAuthTries 3
LoginGraceTime 30
```
Save and exit (`CTRL+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).

### 4. Allow SSH Traffic on Port 4242 and Install UFW

```sh
sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw allow 4242/tcp
sudo ufw enable
```

### 5. Restart SSH Service
Run the following command to apply changes:
```sh
systemctl restart ssh
```

### 6. Connect Using the New SSH Port
Now, you must specify the port when connecting:
```sh
ssh -p 4242 login42@your_server_ip
```
If it doesn't work you did something wrong, be sure to not logout fron root until everything is well set,
If you can't login to your VPS anymore DigitalOcean has a recovery console you can use, check their documentation.

## Enabling X11 Forwarding (GUI Applications Over SSH)

To enable X11 forwarding (useful for running GUI applications), so here a browser to get access locally to login.42.fr follow these steps:

### 1. Enable X11 Forwarding on the Server
Edit the SSH configuration file again:
```sh
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
Find and modify these lines:
```sh
X11Forwarding yes
X11DisplayOffset 10
X11UseLocalhost no
TCPKeepAlive yes
ClientAliveInterval 60
ClientAliveCountMax 3
```
Save and restart SSH:
```sh
systemctl restart ssh
```

### 2. Connect with X Forwarding
From your local machine, connect using:
```sh
ssh -p 4242 -X root@your_server_ip
```

### 3. Set X Authority to enable X11Forwarding
After logging in, run:
```sh
nano ~/.bashrc
```
And add this line at the top
```sh
export XAUTHORITY=~/.Xauthority
```
Reconnect one last time in ssh with the -X flag, you can run GUI applications remotely!

Let's test it 
```sh
sudo apt install chromium
chromium
```

You should have a browser window open that is running locally on your VM.

---

## Further setup, access your server online with a domain name !!

Remember to install comfort application like VIM, Chromium, oh-my-bash, it will make all this easier.
Check docker documentation on how to install it

### 1. Once you have your docker setup working

Edit your nginx.conf file to get access to your server online ! (I won't tell you how to)

Then allow port 443 on UFW
```sh
sudo allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw reload
```

### 2. Setup a domain name for your server

1. Go to [DuckDNS.org](https://duckdns.org).
2. Add a domain, something like **http://yourlogin-inception42.duckdns.org** would fit.
3. Once the domain is created link it to your server ip below and click update ip.
4. Wait a couple minute to a couple hour
5. You should be able to access your wordpress and other settings from this address !!


Congrats you deployed a functioning server for the first time ! 
Enjoy your **42 Inception** setup on DigitalOcean! ðŸš€

## WARNING

### Remember to destroy your VPS once you're done with the project. If you do not YOU WILL BE CREDITED ONCE THE 200$ CREDIT RUN OUT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
